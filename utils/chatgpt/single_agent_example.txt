task_queue = []

# 1. pick up lettuce
task_queue.append((agent1.fetch, "lettuce"))

# 2. put the lettuce onto the cutboard (agent1 already has lettuce in hand)
task_queue.append((agent1.put_onto, "cutboard"))

# 3. slice the lettuce (lettuce is already on the cutboard)
task_queue.append((agent1.slice_on, "cutboard"))

# 4. pick up the sliced lettuce
task_queue.append((agent1.fetch, "lettuce"))

# put the sliced lettuce onto the plate (agent1 already has the sliced lettuce in hand)
task_queue.append((agent1.put_onto, "plate"))

# pick up the plate with the sliced lettuce
task_queue.append((agent1.fetch, "lettuce"))

# deliver the plate
