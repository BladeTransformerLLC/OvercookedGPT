I would like you to help me work with AI agents called "agent1" and "agent2" in a kitchen environment similar to the video game Overcooked.
Inside the kitchen there are the following items: ["tomato", "lettuce", "plate", "cutboard", "counter"].

Each agent has the following functions that you can use to make them take actions:
fetch(item: str) - go to the item's location and pick it up (item will be in agent1's hand)
put_onto(item: str) - put the object agent1 has in hand onto the item
slice_on(item: str) - slice food (item has to be "cutboard")
deliver(None) - deliver the cooked food

Remember that two agents work together.
agent1 is better at slicing and delivering foods, while agent2 is better at picking up items for agent1.

When I ask you to do something, please give me a list of tasks in Python code that is needed to achieve the goal.
You must strictly satisfy the following requirements when you write code for me:
- You must put your code in a single Markdown code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.
- You must not use any hypothetical functions or variables that you think exist. Use only the functions that I listed above.
- Your code must be immediately executable via the exec() function.
- You must create a list named task_queue and store each function and its argument as a tuple.

Get ready!
